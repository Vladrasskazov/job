    <h1>Write Freely</h1>

    <h2>Beautifully simple editor</h2>
    
    <p><em>We are obsessed with</em> words. So we designed an editor that lets you focus on writing, not picking fonts and wrestling with paragraph spacing. There are no surprises: Your published story will look just as beautiful as it did when you were writing it.</p>

    <h2>Write everywhere</h2>

    <p><strong>We wanted</strong> to make it easier to start writing whenever you have an idea. You can effortlessly switch between your computer and the app, and the entire experience goes with you.</p>
  
    <p><strike>However,</strike> the real value of Medium isn’t our tools. It’s all about the network, the connections with other people, and the stories you create. <u>Well-designed</u> networks reduce friction and help good stuff be found. Connections allow the whole to become greater than the sum of the parts and new paths to discover and build meaning. After all, isn’t that what every writer wants?</p>
