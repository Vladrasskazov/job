     <h1>Glossary</h1>
      <h2>3D-Planning</h2>
      <p>3D-Planning makes the of operation procedures for implants more predictable
and safer. Especially in difficult cases with little remaining bone structure,
computer tomography is used to facilitate and prepare the preoperative
planning.</p>
          <h2>Amalgam</h2>
          <p>Amalgam is a dental restorative alloy containing mercury and other materials.
Alternatives are synthetic material, ceramic and gold restaurations</p>
          <h2>Anaesthesia</h2>
            <p>Anaesthesia is the term for temporarily blocking or taking away certain physical
functions in order to make diagnostical or surgical interventions tolerable.</p>
          <h2>Bleaching</h2>
            <p>Bleaching whitens the teeth by applying hydrogen peroxide or carbamide
peroxide (external bleaching) or filling it into a canal treated tooth (internal
bleaching). The interfering colouring agents are decomposed and the teeth are
brightened. The bleaching effects lasts for about one to three years.</p>

          <h2>Bleeding gums</h2>
            <p>Bleeding gums result from an inflammatory disease of the gum.</p>

          <h2>Bone reconstruction</h2>
            <p>Dental bone reconstruction are measures to fill weak parts of the jaw with well
tolerated materials. The organism is stimulated to build new bone structures
that grows into the artificial material and progressively replaces it. Thus, missing
bone can be restructured.</p>

          <h2>Botulinum toxin</h2>
            <p>(Popular name: Botox) A therapeutic agent used for wrinkle injections or for
plastic surgery in cases of deformied or destroyed the teeth or the jaw. Dentists
inject these neurotoxic proteins to fill, correct and restore the mouth.</p>
          <h2>Carbamide peroxide</h2>
            <p>Carbamide peroxide is mainly used as a bleaching or disinfecting agent in
consumer goods such as bleaching, straighening and perm formulars, ear
drops and antiseptic mouthwash, in products to relieve inflammation of gums,
toothpaste and toothbleach. It is also used in contact lens fluids and for
desinfection.</p>

          <h2>Caries</h2>
            <p>Caries is a progressive destruction of the tooth structure caused by the bacterial
acids. Untreat careis can have severe consequences, eg. Painful inflammations
of the dental roots or the „famous“ cracks and holes in the tooth.</p>

          <h2>Ceramic</h2>
            <p>Currently ceramic is the material meeting the highest aesthetic requirements
and on top it is well tolerated. Metal-reinforced restorations can cause
intolerances, allergies, mucosal discolourations or taste disturbance.</p>

          <h2>CMD</h2>
          <p>Craniomandibular dysfunction (CMD) is a disorder of the masticatory system,
the jaw joint, the jaw muscles or the bite.</p>

          <h2>Curettage</h2>
          <p>The open (flap operation) or closed curettage are periodontal treatments.</p>

          <h2>Dental bridge</h2>
            <p>A dental bridge is a fixed partial denture used to replace a missing tooth. A
dental bridge is fixed by joining it permanently to the two adjacent teeth.</p>

          <h2>Dental floss</h2>
            <p>Dental floss helps to clean the spaces between the teeth from plaque and food
particles. Dentists recommend the daily use of dental floss supporting the
regular tooth cleaning. Using dental floss prevents caries and also periodotitis.</p>

          <h2>Dental plaque</h2>
            <p>Plaque consists of several complex layers and contains proteins, carbihydrates,
phospates and microorganisms. Plaque develops where the tooth surface can’tbe kept plaque free by natural or artificial cleaning.</p>

          <h2>Dental pulp</h2>
              <p>The dental pul fills the cavity in the tooth crown and the tooth root. It consists of
tissue, blood vessels, nerves and lymphatics. Bundles of nerves and tissue
reach from the pulp to the dentine. The nerve fibres of the pulp react to any
irritation with a pain sensation.</p>

          <h2>Denture</h2>
            <p>Denture is the generic term for implants, dental crowns, bridges, partial or full
dentures.     </p>

          <h2>DVT</h2>
            <p>Digital volume tomography (DVT) is an X-ray based 3D imaging tomography
method.</p>

          <h2>Early Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>An early diagnosis of tooth diseases is the most important factor for a succesful
treatment. This makes regular examination of the tooth so important</p>

          <h2>Endodontics</h2>
            <p>Endodontics is a root canal therapy applied for cleaning and filling the root
canal system.</p>

          <h2>Flap operation</h2>
            <p>In contrast to closed curettage, during the flap operation the gum is cut from the
tooth and the bone in order to clean the root surface. After monitoring the depth
of the gingival pockets, the operation is carried out under local anaesthesia.</p>

          <h2>Fluoridation</h2>
            <p>Using fluorinated laquers or jelly containing agents in order to harden the tooth
substance. Fluorine supports the tooth’s absorbation of minerals in order to
lower the risk of caries.</p>

          <h2>Full dentures</h2>
            <p>Full dentures replace the complete set of teeth if the patient has lost all teeth.
Full dentures consist of a basis customized to the remaining gum. Fixed to this
basis are the artificial teeth. A thin film of saliva fixes the full denture to the
mucosa, similar to a film of water between two sheets of glass.</p>

          <h2>Gingival pocket</h2>
            <p>The space between the gum and the tooth. Only a very thin slit in a healthy
tooth bed, it can become very wide as a result of peroidontitis. A treatment of
the tooth bed then becomes inevitable in order tp prevent the loss of the tooth.</p>

          <h2>Gingivitis</h2>
            <p>Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gum tissue, often resulting from plaque. The
symptoms of gingivitis are swollen, bright red or purple gums that are tender or
painful to the touch.</p>

          <h2>Gutta-percha</h2>
            <p>Gutta-Percha is an inelastic natural latex produced from the sap of tropical
Gutta-percha native to Southeast Asia and northern Australasia. In dentistry it is
mainly used for root canal treatments and somtimes for temporary fillings, e.g.
in order to bridge the time between preparing and inserting an inlay. In contrast
to synthetical temporary materials, fillings made of gutta-percha can be
removed in one piece.</p>

          <h2>Halitosis</h2>
            <p>Halitosis originates from volatile sulfur compounds that mix with the exhaled air.
These substances are produced e.g. during the bacterial decomposition of food
residue or dead tissue.</p>

          <h2>Hyaluronic Acid</h2>
            <p>Hyaluronic acid is used, amongst others, for wrinkle treatment, for modelling
lips, freshening the skin or to shape the facial contours. Depending on the
stabilisation of the hyaluronic acid the effect lasts for 6 – 12 months. Agents
with different size of the gel particles are available for various treatments.</p>

          <h2>Hydrogen peroxide</h2>
            <p>Hydrogen peroxide is mainly used as a bleaching or disinfecting agent in
consumer goods such as bleaching, straighening and perm formulars, ear
drops and antiseptic mouthwash, in products to relieve inflammation of gums,
toothpaste and toothbleach. It is also used in contact lens fluids and for
desinfection.</p>

          <h2>Immune System</h2>
            <p>The immune system is the protection system of biological structures and
processes. Portections systems can be weak or strong – the immune system
protects the organism against pathogenic agents and diseases. In case of a
comparatively weak immune system, one will fall ill quicker and be more prone
to illesses. The immune system is genetically determined and it can be
influenced. All living beings have all immune system functions.</p>

          <h2>Implants</h2>
            <p>An implant is a artificial device manufactured to replace a missing biological
structure, support a damaged biological structure or enhance existing biological
structure or functions.</p>

          <h2>Jaw</h2>
            <p>The jaw is the bone strutcure embedding the teeth. The upper jaw is fixed to the
skull, the jaw joint keeps the lower jaw moveable.</p>

          <h2>Laser therapy</h2>
            <p>One of the advantages of laser therapy is that stitching the wound becomes
unnecessary and bleedings can virtually be ruled out. The laser sterilizes the
treatment points so that bacterial infections occur very rarely. Laser therapy
also results in shorter healing times compared to conventional methods.</p>

          <h2>Lower jaw</h2>
            <p>The lower jaw, also called ‘mandible’, is a bone of the facial skull. Of the two
jawvbones, the lower jaw is the moveable one.</p>

          <h2>Mastication</h2>
            <p>Mastication is a mechanical process that is very important for the digestion as it
crushes and chops the food. The mastication process is an up-and-down-
movement of the lower jaw, combined with a lateral movement, mixing the food
and saliva.</p>

          <h2>Ozone therapy</h2>
            <p>Certain methods in the field of alternative medicine applying ozone gas are
called ozone therapy. Some dentists use ozone in order to treat caries without
drilling. Ozone is also used for root canal desinfection or sterilisation of the
tooth surface.</p>

          <h2>OPG</h2>
            <p>An orthopantomogram (OPG or panorex) is a panoramic scanning dental X-ray
of the upper and lower jaw. It shows a two-dimensional view of a half-circle from
ear to ear: all teeth, the jaws, the jaw joints as well as the right and the left
maxilary sinus are depicted. An OPG also shows the lateral neck making
arteriosclerosis of the carotid visible, the only annoying factor being the x-ray
shadow of the spine.</p>

          <h2>Orthopaedics</h2>
            <p>Orthopedic surgery or orthopaedics (also spelled orthopedics) is the branch of
surgery concerned with
the development, prevention, diagnostics and treatment of congenital or
acquired conditions involving the musculoskeletal system i.e. the bones, the
joints, muscles, tendon – and the patients’ rehabilitation.</p>

          <h2>Palate</h2>
            <p>The palate is the upper wall ort he ceiling of the oral cavity.</p>

          <h2>Partial dentures</h2>
            <p>Partial dentures are mostl made of ceramic fixed to the remaining healthy teeth.
They rebuild the chewing function and improve blurred articulation caused by
missing teeth. On top they ensure a good cosmetic result.</p>

          <h2>Periodontitis</h2>
            <p>Periodontitis is a set of bacterial inflammatory diseases affecting and
irreversibly destructing the tissues that surround and support the teeth.</p>

          <h2>Prophylaxis</h2>
            <p>Prophylaxis is any medical procedure whose purpose is to prevent a disease,
i.e. precaution.</p>

          <h2>Prosthetics</h2>
            <p>Dental prosthetics or prosthetic dentistry, is a dental specialty pertaining to the
rehabilitation of missing teeth and parts of the jaws. It includes all relevant
biological, functional, psychosocial, material related and technological aspects.</p>

          <h2>PZR</h2>
            <p>Professional cleaning is a prophylactic treatment during which hard and soft
plaque is removed from the tooth surface and the spaces between the teeth.
Surface polishing and fluoridation of the teeth complete the treatment.</p>

          <h2>Root canal treatment</h2>
            <p>A root canal treatment becomes necessary when the dental pulp is inflamed or
has already died off.
The reason in most cases is a far progressed, untreated caries with bacteria
having reached the dental pulp. As a consequence the dental pulp is inflamed
and dies off.</p>

          <h2>Root tip resection</h2>
            <p>The removal of the root tip and inflamed jaw bone tissue. A treatment for teeth
that are healthy enough to be preserved: their structure has to be good and
they have have a firm hold in the jaw bone.</p>

          <h2>Root tip resection or cyst removal</h2>
            <p>A root tip resection or the removal of a cyst (a closed groth containing fluid,
mostly benign tumors, eg. In the jaw bone) can lead to a small cavity in the jaw
bone. If necessary, it can be filled with bone material.Suction</p>

          <h2>Suction</h2>
            <p>Dentures are held in place thanks to the suction effect of the thin film of saliva
between the prothesis and the palatine mucosa. The strength of the adhesion
depends on the form of the jaw, the oral mucosa and the patient’s salivation.
Because of the wider surface a full prothesis usually fits better in the upper jaw
than in the lower jaw where we find less convenient anatomical conditions. The
tongue-space and the flexiblbe tongue make it difficult to achieve a comparably
strong suction.</p>

          <h2>Tartar</h2>
            <p>Tartar is a form of hardened dental plaque that cannot be removed neither by
rinsing nor by brushing. It is caused by the continual accumulation of minerals
from saliva on plaque on the teeth. Tartar does not cause periodontitis, but
plaque bacteria can attach to ist rough surface. If there is no plaque on the
teeth, tartar cannot build up.</p>

          <h2>Titanium</h2>
            <p>It is not long since titanium has been used to manufactur dental inlays,
therefore the casting technique hasn’t yet been perfectioned to 100%. Titanium
inlays are often faced with ceramic due to its silver grey colour.</p>

          <h2>Tooth crown</h2>
            <p>Crowns belong to the permanently fixed dentures. They are used to replace a
missing tooth or if the natural crown is severly damaged. Like caps crowns are
put on the prepared and ground teeth.</p>

          <h2>Tooth root</h2>
            <p>Crowns belong to the permanently fixed dentures. They are used to replace a
missing tooth or if the natural crown is severly damaged. Like caps crowns are
put on the prepared and ground teeth.</p>

          <h2>Tooth stump</h2>
            <p>A ground tooth prepared for a denture.</p>

          <h2>Ultrasound</h2>
            <p>With the help of an ultrasound depurator one can gently remove plaque from
the tooth necks under the gums. Ultrasound treatment basically makes the
plaque explode into very small pieces, after which it falls off.</p>

          <h2>Veneers</h2>
            <p>Veneers are thin ceramic layers placed over a tooth surface that are mainly
used for cosmetical treatments of the front teeth. Veneers cover discoloured
teeth or malpositions.</p>

          <h2>Wisdom teeth</h2>
            <p>Of the complete 32 teeth we have, the wisdom teeth only grow between the age
of 16 to 18 years, which can cause problems. In some cases though, they fit
and integrate well into the set of teeth and do not have to be removed.</p>
